On its surface, it seems like a simple problem, and, in implementation, proved to be very simple. What follows is a picture of the final code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;!--Summary ends here --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;/img/CleanDateThing.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;Clean Code\&quot; style=\&quot;width:100%\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward, right? What follows below is how I initially tried to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;/img/MessyDateThing.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;Messy Code\&quot; style=\&quot;width:100%\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Horrible, isn’t it? A function whose contents are essentially just three lines (and could be shrunk even further, but for the sake of clarity I left them as is) ballooned out to the hideous monstrosity above for no reason other than intellectual laziness. Here’s a (likely incomplete) list of problems that I saw in my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Failure to understand what was going to be used as input:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This seems to be particularly obvious when I thought about it. The form I used to input the date was 2016/02/1 for single digit day numbers and 2016/02/12 for double digit day numbers. In both formats, the month takes up the same two positions when the date is turned to a string. Equally as important, the day will always be in the same position.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Failure to understand how the language will interpret the input:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problem above stems from a lack of thought into how Javascript will reads numbers. Compared to something like C++ where there there are a variety of number types (int, float,  double, etc.) Javascript only uses one. When ’04’ is seen as a number in Javascript (as opposed to a string), it interprets it as ‘4’ (again, as a number and not a string). There’s no need to overcomplicate the reading of something that will self-correct to what you’re looking for anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I had a problem to solve:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The conversion of a date in a numeric arrangement to a more appealing form- for example, from &amp;#39;2016/07/12&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;July 12, 2016&amp;#39;.

The nunjucks render plugin allows use of the nunjucks- a templating language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;  In my very inexpert opinion, I estimate Gulp.js to be extremely useful as a labor-saving devise. &lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;  Gulp is an onomatopoeia associated with swallowing.
