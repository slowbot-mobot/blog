Something I find confusing in the process of learning multiple languages is how that one can write code that isn’t very language-y. 

One can write loops within loops within loops for a language like Javascript, and the notation will look almost (if not completely) identical to C++. Just because they look similar, doesn’t mean they are.

<!--Summary ends here -->

Consider if you wanted to communicate to someone that you liked a dog. If you were to say in Spanish, “Me gusta el perro marron,” that would be an effective way to say that you like the brown dog, as would saying “I like the brown dog,” in English. However, if you were to take “me gusto el perro marron” and try to literally translate it, you could end up with something like “The dog that is brown is pleasing to me.” Effectively you’re communicating a similar message, but nobody would really talk like that, it would potentially confuse some people, and it is noticeably slower if your are doing it millions of times a second (and here’s where the metaphor breaks down). 

The point being, that given how languages are interpreted and conventions are used, there are very good reasons for iterating in different manners for different languages, even if it’s possible to phrase it the same way.
