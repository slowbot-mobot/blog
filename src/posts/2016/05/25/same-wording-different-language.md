While coding and speech are very different things, since they both involve “languages,” you might as well make use of the metaphor when the opportunity arises.

<!--Summary ends here -->

One can write loops within loops within loops for a language with a relatively high level of abstraction language like Ruby, and depending on how you write them, the notation may look very similar to a language with a far lower level of abstraction, like C++. However, just because they look similar doesn’t mean they are.

Consider a situation wherein you want to communicate to someone that you like a dog. If you were to say in Spanish, “Me gusta el perro marron,” that would be an effective way to say that you like the brown dog, as would saying “I like the brown dog,” in English. However, if you were to take “me gusto el perro marron” and try to literally translate it, you could end up with something like “The dog that is brown is pleasing to me.” Effectively you’re communicating a similar message, but nobody would really talk like that, it would potentially confuse some people, and it is noticeably slower if your are doing it millions of times a second (and here’s where the metaphor breaks down). 

It is important to consider both how your language will be interpreted and how its conventions are commonly used when you decide to pick one up. It’ll be the difference between incomprehensibility and effective communication.
