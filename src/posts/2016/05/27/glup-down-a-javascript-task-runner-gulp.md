  Gulp is an onomatopoeia associated with swallowing. Gulp.js is a task runner for Javascript.

<!--Summary ends here -->

  Thus far in my coding career, I find Gulp.js to be useful, but I imagine that I would probably respect it more if I had much experience putting together a website without it. 

  Its performs a number of functions in my blog (the thing you are probably reading this from), the most obvious are the minimization and concatenation of files prior to deployment, cutting out the fat of what’s going up on the page itself. For the purposes of testing, Jim helped me implement a sync functionality which allows for on the fly updating and revising of the code being used. The nunjucks render plugin allows use of the nunjucks- a templating language.

  In my very inexpert opinion, I estimate Gulp.js to be extremely useful as a labor-saving devise.
