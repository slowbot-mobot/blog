However, just because they look similar doesn’t mean they are.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Consider a situation wherein you want to communicate to someone that you like a dog. If you were to say in Spanish, “Me gusta el perro marron,” that would be an effective way to say that you like the brown dog, as would saying “I like the brown dog,” in English. However, if you were to take “me gusto el perro marron” and try to literally translate it, you could end up with something like “The dog that is brown is pleasing to me.” Effectively you’re communicating a similar message, but nobody would really talk like that, it would potentially confuse some people, and it is noticeably slower if your are doing it millions of times a second (and here’s where the metaphor breaks down). &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is important to consider both how your language will be interpreted and how its conventions are commonly used when you decide to pick one up. It’ll be the difference between incomprehensibility and effective communication. &lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;While coding and speech are very different things, since they both involve “languages,” you might as well make use of the metaphor when the opportunity arises.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;published_on&quot;:&quot;Wednesday, May 25 2016&quot;},{&quot;title&quot;:&quot;If You Don&#39;t Scope, You&#39;re a Dope&quot;,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Glen&quot;,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;/blog/2016/05/26/if-you-dont-scope-youre-a-dope.html&quot;,&quot;date_string&quot;:&quot;2016/05/26&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:[&quot;javascript&quot;,&quot;scoping&quot;,&quot;closure&quot;],&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Scoping refers to what is “readable” or “available” to different methods in a given program, and is one of the more intuitive aspects of programming.

For the purposes of testing, Jim helped me implement a sync functionality which allows for on the fly updating and revising of the code being used. The nunjucks render plugin allows use of the nunjucks- a templating language.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;  In my very inexpert opinion, I estimate Gulp.js to be extremely useful as a labor-saving devise. &lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;  Gulp is an onomatopoeia associated with swallowing.

On its surface, it seems like a simple problem, and, in implementation, proved to be very simple. What follows is a picture of the final code.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;!--Summary ends here --&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;/img/CleanDateThing.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;Clean Code\&quot; style=\&quot;width:100%\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pretty straightforward, right? What follows below is how I initially tried to solve it.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\&quot;/img/MessyDateThing.png\&quot; alt=\&quot;Messy Code\&quot; style=\&quot;width:100%\&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Horrible, isn’t it? A function whose contents are essentially just three lines (and could be shrunk even further, but for the sake of clarity I left them as is) ballooned out to the hideous monstrosity above for no reason other than intellectual laziness. Here’s a (likely incomplete) list of problems that I saw in my thinking.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Failure to understand what was going to be used as input:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This seems to be particularly obvious when I thought about it. The form I used to input the date was 2016/02/1 for single digit day numbers and 2016/02/12 for double digit day numbers. In both formats, the month takes up the same two positions when the date is turned to a string. Equally as important, the day will always be in the same position.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Failure to understand how the language will interpret the input:&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problem above stems from a lack of thought into how Javascript will reads numbers. Compared to something like C++ where there there are a variety of number types (int, float,  double, etc.) Javascript only uses one. When ’04’ is seen as a number in Javascript (as opposed to a string), it interprets it as ‘4’ (again, as a number and not a string). There’s no need to overcomplicate the reading of something that will self-correct to what you’re looking for anyways.&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;summary&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I had a problem to solve:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The conversion of a date in a numeric arrangement to a more appealing form- for example, from &amp;#39;2016/07/12&amp;#39; to &amp;#39;July 12, 2016&amp;#39;.
